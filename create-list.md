# Creating Your Own List

- Read the [rockstar manifesto](rockstar.md) and [list guidelines](pull_request_template.md) and ensure your list complies.
- Search this list before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate. If it is, try and contribute to the best one instead of making your own.
- You might find [this Yeoman generator](https://github.com/dar5hak/generator-rockstar-list) useful.
- **Wait at least 30 days after creating a list before submitting it, to give it a chance to mature.**
- **Make sure you read the [list guidelines](pull_request_template.md) again before submitting a pull request for your list to be added here.**

Thanks for being rockstar! 😎
